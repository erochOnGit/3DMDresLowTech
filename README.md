Idea for a game :
A character that want to play games.  
And his surroundings telling him to get out of numeric world.  
The game is showing that even if he spend time on the numeric,  
he is part of the world as the person that are not on the numeric.  
So much that he finish to care more for the environmental issues than the "normal poeple".  
And he finish to be able to do more for the planet than anyone around him.
